# IOT BASED ECG MONITORING SYSTEM USING UBIDOTS
The IoT-Based ECG Monitoring System is a smart healthcare project designed to monitor a patientâ€™s heart activity in real time. It utilizes IoT technology and cloud platforms to collect, process, and display ECG (Electrocardiogram) data remotely, ensuring continuous monitoring and quick response in case of abnormalities.
## Technologies Used
## List the technologies and tools used:
### Hardware: 
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32), ECG sensor (e.g., AD8232), Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32)
### Software: 
Ubidots IoT platform, Arduino IDE for programming, any libraries used (e.g., Ubidots library, ECG sensor library)
### Others: 
IoT, Cloud computing
